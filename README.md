Personal developer environment and local `ws` workflow workspace.

This repo started as dotfiles and a workstation bootstrap script. It now also
contains the local `ws` and `wsflow` plugin packages, the native `ws-mcp`
runtime source, and workflow docs for that system.

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kang-sw/devenv.git ~/devenv
cd ~/devenv
bash install.sh          # idempotent; safe to re-run
bash install.sh update   # skip packages & sudo, refresh config and symlinks
```

> Neovim 0.10+ is required but not installed by the script.

## What's Inside

```
nvim/                  Neovim config
shell/                 tmux, WezTerm, Starship, zsh, helper scripts
tools/                 local Claude session TUIs
agents-plugin/         ws plugin package
agents-plugin-wsflow/  agentless wsflow plugin package
agents-plugin-tool/    native ws MCP runtime and tooling source
ai-docs/               workflow specs, tickets, mental models, references
```

- **Workstation config**: Neovim, tmux, WezTerm, Starship, zsh, shell helpers,
  and editor/tooling defaults for day-to-day development.
- **Local TUIs**: `claude-watch` and `claude-dash` live under `tools/`.
- **`ws` plugin**: Codex-first workflow skills plus the `ws-mcp` runtime.
  Claude Code compatibility uses the `agents-plugin/` package metadata; there is
  no live `claude-plugin/` source tree.
- **`wsflow` plugin**: Agentless workflow skills that reuse the shared runtime
  without ws managed-agent orchestration.
- **Runtime source**: Go tooling and MCP server code under `agents-plugin-tool/`.
- **Workflow docs**: specs, tickets, mental models, and references under
  `ai-docs/`.

## install.sh

Detects macOS, WSL, and Linux. Full mode installs packages and writes config.
`update` mode skips package installation and refreshes dotfiles, symlinks, and
local plugin setup.

## ws Plugin

The active `ws` plugin package lives in `agents-plugin/`.

Codex installs use the repository marketplace entries under `.agents/plugins/`.
Claude-compatible marketplace metadata lives under `.claude-plugin/`.

Local bootstrap registers a Claude-compatible snapshot from `agents-plugin/`
when Claude Code is available:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add kang-sw/devenv
claude plugin install ws@kang-sw-devenv
```

The agentless `wsflow` package lives in `agents-plugin-wsflow/` for separate
marketplace installation. `install.sh` does not install `wsflow` into Claude.

## Pi Adapter

The `ws` workflow tools are also available inside Pi
(`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) sessions through a bundled extension.
Install it straight from this repo with Pi's own git package manager:

```sh
pi install git:github.com/kang-sw/devenv@<tag>
```

Replace `<tag>` with a published release tag (for example `v0.46.8`). The
`<host>` segment (`github.com`) is required — Pi's git spec is
`git:<host>/<user>/<repo>`, and a host-less `git:kang-sw/devenv` mis-parses
`kang-sw` as the host and fails to resolve.

Pi clones the repo, runs `npm install` against the repo-root
`package.json` (which declares the extension and its runtime dependencies),
and loads the extension. No local build step is required: on first use the
extension's launcher downloads the release's `ws-mcp` binary, verifies its
checksum, and registers the `ws/*` tools automatically.
